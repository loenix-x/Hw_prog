Astro test package

This project is designed to analyze images of calcium events of the tripartite synapse obtained under a microscope. Two types of image folders are needed for data analysis: "events", where pixels will have only two values - black (absence of calcium activity) or white (presence of calcium event) and "images" directly black and white images from a microscope.

To apply the code, you need to save the path to a variable and then call the function final_func('the variable in which the path lies')

All received tables and graphs will be saved in a separate folder
